# bash-completion-for-doas

This project was ment to replace sudo with doas. However this project is no longer required due to the AUR 

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR) 
Use an AUR helper, in this example I used paru 

```shell
paru opendoas-sudo 
```

This will syslink doas with sudo, so you can write sudo on the terminal to execute doas.
